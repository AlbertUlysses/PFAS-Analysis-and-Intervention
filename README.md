# PFAS-Analysis-and-Intervention

Analysis of PFAS contamination level data may be time consuming or the personnel to do the analysis is non-existent. With PFAS awareness and monitoring on the rise the goal of this project is to prepare testing organizations for further regulations, expedite the analysis process, as well as help to proactively implement interventions to prevent further contamination. The anticipated impacts would be to identify possible sources of contamination and stop the spread of PFAS at the source as well as implementing monitoring events.

The working app can be found here: https://meldataaa.shinyapps.io/PFAS_Analysis_and_Intervention/

Use Test Data.csv to see the visualizations currently being produced when a user uploads their data in the correct format.

# Ideas for Further Improvement
Some of these are merely thoughts while some need minor code changes.

## Analysis
- Weather API implementation
  -	Given a user inputs a start and end date of their data and a lat/long of the test site location, pull historical weather data and plot variables such as rainfall.
  -	Historical weather data must be paid for on Googles OpenWeatherMap service as well as Dark Sky API
- Watershed
-	Add any other useful visualizations for chemical concentrations, weather, etc. 

## Possible Intervention
-	Zoom to Site Location as opposed to all of California
-	Filter list to show locations within a certain radius of the specified site location
-	Export list of facilities
-	Choose multiple facility types
- Add other location types
  -	Military Facilities
  -	Airports
  -	Firefighting Training Facilities
  -	EPAâ€™s Superfund National Priorities List (NPL)
  -	US Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)

## Other
- Better format? Dashboard? Map with interactive layers?
- This application could easily be used for other contaminants as well, if the user's data is in the specified format.
- Open to all ideas and suggestions!

## PFAS in California: Past, Present, and Future
Melissa Salazar, Andrew Cullen
- Andrew was able to pull data from the PFAS database hosted by the California Water Boards to test the functionality of the app
    - Nut Plains - Sacramento 3410010-010.csv
- I, Melissa Salazar, was able to find an R package called rnoaa that will use a lat/long position to find the nearest weather station and provided weather data from NOAA
    -https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnoaa/rnoaa.pdf
    -https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa
    -https://recology.info/2015/07/weather-data-with-rnoaa/
    -https://rdrr.io/cran/rnoaa/man/meteo_nearby_stations.html
    - Weather Analysis.Rmd is a short example to test how the package works

### December 12th, 2019
- Format changes were made, from an rmarkdown with shiny widgets to a flex dashboard
- Precipitation widgets will be added in the near future!
